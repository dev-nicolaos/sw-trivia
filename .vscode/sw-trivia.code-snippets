	// Place your sw-trivia workspace snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders.
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Add Trivia Question": {
		"scope": "javascript,typescript",
		"prefix": ":q",
		"body": [
      "{",
      "  question: \"$1\",",

      "  wrongAnswers: [\"$3\", \"$4\", \"$5\"],",
      "  source,",
