## How to Start the Game

1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Type `sw-trivia` to start the game
   - add the `--version` flag (`-v` for short) to see version information about the game
   - add the `--stats` flag (`-s` for short) to see statistics about the game's trivia content
3. Type the number of the option you'd like to select and press `Enter` to proceed

## Development

This project is built with [Deno](https://deno.land)

Although this project uses a stable version of Deno, it needs the `--unstable` flag for a few APIs and makes use of the [Deno Standard Modules](https://deno.land/std) which are pre 1.0.
Because of this, it is still recommended to use the specific version of Deno listed in `src/version.ts`.
The program will warn the user if the version of Deno being run does not match the version listed there.

### Scripts

By default these scripts will prompt for various permissions, such as reading/writing to the filesystem or spawning a subprocess.
To bypass these prompts, add Deno's `-A` flag to the command.
For more info on how script permissions work in Deno, check out the
[permissions page in the manual](https://deno.land/manual@main/getting_started/permissions).
